## Sextant Frontend Development Project
This project is focused on developing a frontend for the Sextant network automation tool using React and other web technologies. The project is divided into several tasks, each of which is designed to help you gain practical skills in React development, npm package management, and Git version control.

## Project Initialization
Before you can begin working on the Sextant frontend, you will need to set up your local development environment. This will involve installing the necessary software packages, configuring your development environment, and cloning the Sextant repository from GitHub.

## Design the Sextant Frontend
The first major task in this project is to design the Sextant frontend using a series of reusable React components. You will need to use your design thinking skills to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface that allows users to manage their network devices and configurations.

## Display the User's Public IP
In this task, you will retrieve and display the user's public IP address in the Sextant frontend. This will require you to use React to create a component that can make a network request to retrieve the user's IP address and display it on the screen.

## Stream Data from a Networked Service
In this task, you will use the WebSocket protocol to connect to an external network service and stream data to the Sextant frontend. This will require you to use your networking skills to set up a WebSocket connection and handle incoming data from the network service.

## Present Your Work
Finally, you will need to present your work by recording a short video showcasing what you have built. This will require you to use communication skills to effectively convey your ideas and demonstrate the functionality of the Sextant frontend.
